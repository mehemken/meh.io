    <h1>Review of CloudFormation and Terraform</h1>

    <h1>Article: Review</h1>
<p>I used CloudFormation and Terraform to create a sandbox environment for learning Ansible. At the time of this writing I am learning both tools, so it is not an expert opinion. I have used CloudFormation in production, but not Terraform.</p>
<p>CloudFormation is a service that helps you model and set up your AWS resources so that you can spend less time managing those resources and more time focusing on you applications. Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Both tools use configuration files to describe components required by your infrastructure.</p>
<h2>Pictures</h2>
<p>I enjoyed using both tools. I found it very useful that CloudFormation templates can be used to generate a descriptive diagram of your infrastructure. Working with a client or manager, they will inevitably ask "is it done yet?" and you can show them a diagram to show your progress. No such tool exists for Terraform.</p>
<p><a href="/static/images/articles/review-cloudformation-terraform/cf-diagram.png" title="Pretty picture">CloudFormation diagram</a> &lt;&lt; Picture!</p>
<p>That image was generated with a tool in the AWS management console. It is free and easy to use. It accepts both JSON and YAML format config files. You can even use it to turn a JSON config into YAML and vice versa. </p>
<p>Terraform has a <code>graph</code> command (<a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/graph.html" title="Command: graph">docs</a>) which also generates an image (with the help of the 3rd party <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/" title="Graph visualization software">graphviz tool</a>). However, the purpose of that is not to show a visual description of your infrastructure. It is generates a visual representation of an execution plan. You wouldn't show it to a client. It is ugly.</p>

<h2>Template language</h2>
<p>CloudFormation templates are written in JSON or YAML. JSON would make it easy to generate a template with a script. YAML is very human writeable. Terraform can be written in JSON and a custom templating language called HCL. HashiCorp recommends you use HCL. You cannot write a Terraform template in YAML unfortunately.</p>
<h2>Flow control</h2>
<p>The really nice thing about Terraform is that you have features that approximate flow control. You don't exactly have a for loop or if statements, but really you do. You have the "meta-parameter" <code>count</code>. For more on this check out the <a href="https://blog.gruntwork.io/terraform-tips-tricks-loops-if-statements-and-gotchas-f739bbae55f9" title="And this is why Terraform is awesome">excelent post</a> by Yevgeniy Brikman. This means that a Terraform template will be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" title="Don't repeat yourself.">DRY</a>.</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>

</blockquote>
<p>I've taken the time to write a sandbox infrastructure in both CloudFomration YAML and Terraform HCL. It describes an internet connected VPC with a public subnet. In the subnet we have some ubuntu/redhat/windows servers. The Terraform template is 113 lines and the CloudFormation template is 186 lines.</p>
<p>This is a tiny project and the difference in length of the templates is already really noticable. Not to mention, the HCL is full of lines that have a single curly brace. YAML is very dense. Furthermore, the CloudFormation template only describes five servers. The HCL allows me to change a single number to describe as many servers as I want. Not only that, I've configured it so that I'll always have an equal proportion of ubuntu/redhat/windows servers (given the number of servers is a multiple of three). I don't need to change the output configuration or anything.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Both tools are great. I'd rather use these than manually click through the console UI. It is a very nice UI and sometimes I do fall back for little things. But when designing and creating infrastructure, this is the way to go. I really wish though, that CloudFormation had flow control. And I wish Terraform had a nice visualization tool.</p>
<p>The CloudFormation problem can be fixed by frameworks such as <a href="https://github.com/cloudtools/troposphere" title="troposphere">troposphere</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bazaarvoice/cloudformation-ruby-dsl" title="cloudformation-ruby-dsl">cloudformation-ruby-dsl</a>. (I have not vetted those tools, it's just a google search). They don't look like they've fully matured but I'm just guessing.</p>
<p>Hopefully there are tools to visualize Terraform templates. Cloudcraft has it on its radar, but nothing shows they're actually working on it. It is in their <a href="https://trello.com/c/rsDCPHDz/65-add-export-import-from-terraform-template" title="Cloudcraft roadmap">roadmap</a>. If they implement this it would be really good for Terraform. Cloudcraft diagrams are even better than the CloudFormation ones. They are marketing collateral qualitiy pictures.</p>
<p>These are both young tools and they will be improving a lot I'm sure.</p>
